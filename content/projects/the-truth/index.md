My partner and I used the concept “don’t believe everything you see.” Again I challenge visual stereotypes by allowing the audience to have their assumption in hand. We used different cuts and angles to prove that you need the complete picture to know the complete truth. In the meantime what they believed had happened was different than what actually happened.
