      <p> McGee loved Abby, others might say he was obsessed with her. Although they ended their relationships a couple of months, he knew he could never forget her. He remembered eveything about her. He knew her favorite color all the down to detailed items like the way she liked her coffee. However, that was in the past and now Abby is with Tony. This went against rule number 13, never dated a coworker. Tony was careless with Abby. Abby couldn't let him go despite his constant cheating and flirtacious ways.McGee knew there was only one thing left to do, kill him and keep Abby all to himself.</p>

      <p> Fighting bad guys was tiring for baby NCIS. At the end of each case they all gathered together with Gibbs on his bed. Although Gibbs was always in the middle, he didn't mind. Evryone was snuggled up ready to listen to the first story of the night. His stories were a combination of nonfiction and fiction. Tonight was the night that Gibbs revealed his cold blooded killed. The team thought it was a fiction story, however they were completely wrong.<p> 
      <h2> DiNozzo Family</h2>
